### API
Application Programming Interface, or API, is a way for different software components to communicate and exchange data. 
APIs are used to create powerful, reliable, secure, and capable applications that meet the needs of users. 
They are everywhere, constantly running in the background, providing digital capabilities that are essential to our modern lives.

APIs operate on the principle of information exchange between programs, systems, and devices.
This process takes place in the form of a loop consisting of a request and a response. The user launches a request to receive data by interacting with the application.
The request is passed to the API, which extracts the data and sends it back to the user.
