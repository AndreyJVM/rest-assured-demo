###  [RestAssured ](https://rest-assured.io/)

Testing and validating REST services in Java is harder than in dynamic languages such as Ruby and Groovy.
RESTAssured brings the simplicity of using these languages into the Java domain.

### API
Application Programming Interface, or API, is a way for different software components to communicate and exchange data. 
APIs are used to create powerful, reliable, secure, and capable applications that meet the needs of users. 
They are everywhere, constantly running in the background, providing digital capabilities that are essential to our modern lives.

APIs operate on the principle of information exchange between programs, systems, and devices.
This process takes place in the form of a loop consisting of a request and a response. The user launches a request to receive data by interacting with the application.
The request is passed to the API, which extracts the data and sends it back to the user.

The key point to start with is understanding the concept of **client-server architecture**. In this architecture, 
the client plays the role of data recipient, and the server plays the role of information provider.

#### Client
A client is a system or application that accesses a remote system for information. 
The client sends a request to the server and receives a response.

#### Server
A server is a computer system or application that serves as a data source. It is capable of transmitting 
information over a network, including the Internet. The functionality provided by the server is called services.
These services are provided to customers in response to their requests.


#### HTTP Response Codes

* 1xx - Informational responses.
* 2xx - Successfully processed responses.
* 3xx - Redirection.
* 4xx - Client errors.
* 5xx - Server errors.
